                        <p>A: Outside food and beverage is permitted, but must be consumed in designated areas.</p>

                        <p>A: John Mulaney had the wrong idea. The animals live here, and just like humans, need their alone time. If an animal is not on visibile from your viewing location, that leaves something to look forward to on your next visit!</p>

                        <p>A: If you didn't enjoy your time with us we know a good doctor that we could refer you to.</p>
