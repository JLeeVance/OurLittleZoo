                    <p>Q: Can I bring my own food to the zoo?</p>
                    <p>A: Outside food and beverage is permitted, but must be consumed in designated areas.</p>

                    <p>Q: What if the animals are not out for me to see them?</p>
                    <p>A: John Mulaney had the wrong idea. The animals live here, and just like humans, need their alone time. If an animal is not on visibile from your viewing location, that leaves something to look forward to on your next visit!</p>

                    <p>A: If you didn't enjoy your time with us we know a good doctor that we could refer you to.</p>
